# IoT-Smart-Light-System-with-ESP8266-and-Blynk-App
This project involves using the ESP8266 WiFi module to control a light (LED) remotely via the Blynk app, an easy-to-use IoT platform.
Hardware:
ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
LED

Steps:
Set up the Blynk app on your phone.
Create a new project and get an Auth Token from the Blynk app (you will need this in the code).
Use the ESP8266 to control the LED through the app.
